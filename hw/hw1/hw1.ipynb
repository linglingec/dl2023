    "After the proof, if we want to achieve $\\epsilon$ appoximation error based on the above neural network, the number of layers $n$ has to satisfy the condition $\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\\leq \\epsilon$, i.e. $n\\geq \\log_2 \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$.\n",

    "2) Implement this neural network in any framework you like with different $n$ (for example $n = 3, 5, 10, 15$), and then plot the curve for absolute errors for different $n$. Compare the obtained plots with theoretical bound.\n"
