Warriors of the World United LyricsHere our soldiers stand
From all around the world
Waiting in a line
To hear the battle cry
All are gathered here
Victory is near
The sound will fill the hall
Bringing power to us all

We alone are fighting
For metal that is true
We own the right, to live the fight
We're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel
Will never dry
Stand and fight together
Beneath the metal sky

Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Many stand against us
But they will never win
We said we would return
And here we are again!
To bring them all destruction
Suffering, and pain
We are the hammer of the Gods
We are thunder, wind, and rain!
You might also likeThere they wait in fear
With swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king
First, one should be a man
I call about and charge them all
With a life that is a lie
And in their final hour
They shall confess before they die!

Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world

If I should fall in battle
My brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse, and weapons
Tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong
I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way, will die by steel!

Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Kings of Metal Lyrics[Verse 1]
Manowar, Manowar, living on the road
When we're in town, speakers explode
We don't attract wimps
'Cause we're too loud
Just true metal people
That's Manowar's crowd

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up
We're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burning

Heart of Steel LyricsBuilt a fire a thousand miles away
To light my long way home
I ride a comet, my trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone

I fight the world
And take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind
Born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel

Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
You might also likeThey'll watch us rise with fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel

Die For Metal LyricsThey can't stop us
Let them try
For heavy metal
We will die

[Verse 1]
Quit my job this morning, said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly

[Verse 2]
So I walked outside into the streets
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer

[Verse 3]
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother, said
My friends are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you

There's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching
They're marching on me and you

Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air

Hail and Kill LyricsBrothers, I am calling
From the valley of the kings
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead
Together we will ride like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet
Like a young girl in her prime
Hold your hammers high

Blood and death are waiting
Like a raven in the sky

Hear me while I live
Now as I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Now, power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right, hail and kill

Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill

Master of the Wind LyricsIn the silence of the darkness
When all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream
Calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind

Hear the Angels sing
Far beyond the sun
Across the western sky
Reach to the blackness
Find a silver line

In a voice I whisper
A candle in the night
Will carry all our dreams
On a single beam of light

Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring

Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

The clouds will move aside
And there will be the road

Two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems

Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring

Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know

The Sons of Odin LyricsHere to the blaze I wander
Through this black night I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords did clash
Fallen by our axes, helmets smashed

Glory and fame, blood is our name
Souls full of thunder, hearts of steel
Killers of men, of warriors' friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end

One day too, I may fall
I will enter Odin's hall
I will die, sword in hand
My name and my deeds
Will scorch the land

Glory and fame, blood is our name
Souls full of thunder, hearts of steel
Killers of men, of warriors' friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

Sons of the Gods
Today, we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail Gods of war

Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

Sons of the Gods
Today, we shall die
Open Valhalla's door

Hail Gods of war
Onward into the heart of the battle fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times, still they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells that once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day they would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them the berserker rage
Now Gods of men, they rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals, such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods of war

Bridge of Death LyricsSlowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for what's waiting soon will show
And this last time looking back, I'll see my home
For he awaits me, reaching for my soul

He calls my name and waves me on
The fallen one, he stands in flame

Well, the life that he has given
Full of riches and success has a price
That I made good in blood to pay
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance
If I falter on my way

And what God has now forsaken
And man has never seen
Are the riches of the underworld below
All my years of earthly pleasures
Gave support unto the bridge
I now cross it giving him my soul

Dark lord, I summon thee
Demanding the sacred right to burn in Hell
Ride up on Hell's hot wind
Face one more evil than thou
Take my lustful soul
Drink my blood as I drink yours
Impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head, release all my evil
Lucifer is king, praise Satan
You might also likeI know the one who waits
Satan is his name

For eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding
Obey him without question
Even walk among the living if I'm told

Satan, don't forsake me
I wait for you to take me
Grant me wings and as your messenger
I'll flyEmbed

We're glad to leave behind their world of sin

Achilles, Agony And Ecstasy In Eight Parts Lyrics(Prelude)

[I. Hector Storms The Wall]

See my chariot, run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold, the wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The Gods are my shield, my fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall, we are storming the wall
Stones fall like snow from the sky

We will pay with our glory in the fire of battle
Zeus, today is mine
Killing all in my way like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer, I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me, let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword

[II. The Death Of Patroclus]

Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye?
This was your time, but the armor you wore was mine
I will not rest until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken, dragged across the field
This, dear friend, is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky

[V. Hector's Final Hour]

Here inside the walls of Troy, the Gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
Many thousands I did kill
No walls can contain the Gods' almighty will

I hear the silent voices, I cannot hide
The Gods leave no choices, so we all must die
Oh Achilles, let thy arrows fly, into the wind
Where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend

[VI. Death Hector's reward]
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny

When the cards of life were dealt
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge and bringeth fury
Hector, feel my hate
A bloodbath I was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and death
Ties to earth unfasten

Blood and fire, death and hate
Your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh
The Hall of Hades waits
Kill...

Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds
The Gods who once protected him are now his Gods of doom
Like a tower standing tall, steadfast in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the Gods give no protection
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny

Blood and fire death and hate
Your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh
The Hall of Hades waits
Die...

[VII. The Desecration Of Hector's Body]

(Instrumental Part)

[VIII. The Glory Of Achilles]

The oath of the Gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust

A dozen highborn youths have been killed
Cutting their throats, their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the foot of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds

Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire

Hector's blood will not be washed from my body
Until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken, a promise fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed

But she will wait for my command
My chains and collar brought her to her knees

TranslationsРусскийReturn of the Warlord LyricsNow the time has come
When all is said and done
We're back together on the road
It's time to fly
No more time to wait
You know it feels so great
Wearing leather on a horse of steel
I ride

I ain't waiting to get old
I'm running hot, I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me
I don't care
I got my wheels, I got my friends
We're on the road again
We're all crazy
Gonna ride until we die

Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

Losers try to put us down
It's just another day
I got no money or big house
Just got life
I don't like to save, it's more fun to spend
If you like metal, you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard
Well, that's my wife
You might also likeDon't try to understand me
My family never will
Had to punch my teacher out
Now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way, it's my decision
One more beer and heavy metal
And I'm just fine

Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

We are the undefeated
We're not living in the past
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Feel the power of the wheel
Let's drink to riding steel
Living hard and riding fast

Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

Riding horses made of steel

Sleipnir LyricsHe is descended from giants
His father Loki, God of fire
Is the sworn blood brother to Odin himself
He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living to the land of the dead
This eight-legged steed crosses eight points of the compass
From eight directions into eight dimensions
He is the bringer of the valiant dead
From the battlefield to Valhalla

[Chorus 1]
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries, we valiant dead
To the hall of heroes shall be led

[Pre-Chorus]
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died, but never yielded
You might also like[Chorus 1]

Faster than the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of Asgard across the sky
To the world of Gods and men

Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war God Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus 1]

Manowar LyricsWe met on English ground
In a backstage room we heard the sound
And we all knew what we had to do

We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew soon the time
Would come for us to fight
Destination now in sight

Manowar, born to live forevermore
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more

Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands and take a stand
Look sharp when duty calls
Where we march, cities fall
And the strong survive and take our side
Now the time has come for us to fight
Target waiting in our sights

Manowar, born to live forevermore

Hold your ground and give no more

The Gods Made Heavy Metal LyricsIn the beginning there was silence
And darkness, all across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burnt high in the sky

From down below, fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound

The Gods made heavy metal
And they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would

The Gods made heavy metal
And it's never gonna die

In the fire of heavy metal we were burnt

It's the only way to live

Die With Honor LyricsIf I should return
With my body on my shield
Tell my son I chose to die than yield
Though my life may soon be gone
I hope you'll carry on
Remember me as one who would not kneel

Filled with pride

Black Wind, Fire and Steel LyricsFull moon light's calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die

Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel

Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world
I can see in darkness
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near

Born of black wind, fire and steel

Born of black wind, fire and steel

Blood of My Enemies Lyrics[Verse 1]
Three sons have I and they ride by my side
The fierce, the black and the wicked are their names
We ride down my enemies on their half-hearted flight
No voice of mercy, no evangels of light
Mighty messengers, heathens rage

[Verse 2]
Witness our coming, Gods of the death
I ride through the air, I laugh as I die
With powers of evil, dark knowledge is mine
The ride of the wicked, the first sin was trust
Kill without warning, for blood now I lust

[Chorus]
Strong winds, magic mist
To Asgard the Valkyries fly
High overhead, they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies

Odin, hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me

Forever to fight by your side

Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality, be mine

Call the witch to cast the ruins
Weave a magic spell

Not for Heaven, not for Hell

We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky

In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night

Spinning in the dust
Long before your birth
Eating tar and gasoline

Hand of Doom LyricsHands of doom are reaching out
To crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain
No time to run within

And these hands you see before you
Will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind

Your blood's upon the soil
Your body fed to wolves

And the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor

Together we'll fight
And some of us will die

That we made a stand

King of Kings Lyrics[Verse 1]
Voices of victory, all shout and proclaim
The kingdom of glory is mine
The raise of the will, our prophecy filled
I'm the lord of the day and the night
I've nothing to sell but the power of Hell
My armies of fire await
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late

[Chorus]
Crack the earth, Gods of thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the fight, I own the right
To be the king of kings

[Verse 2]
My enemies rise and look to the skies
They pray I will never appear
Their life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear

[Verse 3]
I summon the Demons that live in the wind
As my chariot drives in the storm
With the hot blood of battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

[Narration]
All the days of his life he walked without fear
All whose lives he touched were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So true his justice and retribution were unfailing

As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and magic wind
The kingdom of the king

Dark Avenger LyricsHe broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eyes
Took his land and fortune
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline
Left for the tide
Sees his lifeblood leaving
Circling lower, the vultures fly

His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign

From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry

And in the world above
The elders sing
On his land they live
Let death's bell ring

[Narration]
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls, the Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him
"Let you not pass, abandon
Return to the world from whence you came
And seek payment, not only for thine own anguish
But vindicate the souls of the Unavenged"
And they placed in his hands a sword made for him
Called Vengeance, forged in brimstone
And tempered by the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey back to the upper world
They brought forth their Demon horse called Black Death
A grim steed so fearsome in might and black in colour
That he could stand as one with the darkness
Save for his burning eyes of crimson fire
And on that night they rose up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves did clap like thunder

Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives

No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you

[Chorus]

I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get their lives
But when I'm through they know they must pay

[Chorus]

With their lives, with their lives

Blood And Steel LyricsMy right hand is thunder, your blood's upon my soul
My left hand is lightning, the gods of war bestowed
A blood vow was sworn, so all shall come to know

Odin LyricsIn the halls of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me

I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death

Speared, hung upside down
Nine days and nights
No food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself

Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me

Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring
By sword and spear and ring

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die, let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home

Loki God Of Fire LyricsThe son of giants
Walks across the sky
To the gods a friend
Fathered beast and men

As a falcon he did fly
Far across the sky
To take back the hammer

The world of gods and men

He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell

Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding
I heard the Heavens scream his name

And called to Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end

God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never-ending curse

Il nome mio nessun sapra', no, no
Sulla tua bocca lo diro'

Ed il mio bacio sciogliera' il silenzio

And my kiss will dissolve the silence
That makes you mine

The Power LyricsI've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free
To die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave
Of ashes in an urn

The power in the darkness
To see without my sight
Walk among the living
Free of wrong and right
The power of the magic
The power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven
But one day rule in Hell

Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power

This power's greater
Than love and of hate
Is this the power of will and of fate?
The power to kill, the power to feel
The power of blood
The triumph of steel

Power, power, power, power

None can fight the power
None can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death
Are carried there within
Call out to the power
Of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth
Be lord of all the light

Kill all those who stand against you
Look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh
As they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves
Then cast the final spell
Fly into the night and
One day meet in Hell

I heard a call all should know
It's my time, I'm alive
Some will come, some will go
But most will never know
That greatness lives inside

Speak your mind, put me down
Say your prayers when I'm around

Shorn of hopes and dream
I don't buy their foolish schemes

Blow Your Speakers LyricsI wrote a letter to the M.T.V
What's going on now?
Don't you care about me?
Sent the same letter to the radio
But my party went dead
Like a shot in the head

We all like it-Rock and Roll
We all want it-On your show
Play it loud,don't play it low
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll

We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playing
It just ain't worth my saying
People want music to get them moving
We don't want labels
We want music on the table

We all like it-Rock and Roll
We all want it-on your show
Play it loud,don't play it low
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll

The Warrior’s Prayer LyricsGrandfather, tell me a story!
All right, go and get your storybook
No, no, not one of those, a real story!
A real story?
Yes, tell me about when you were a boy
Well, then, I shall have to take you back with me
A long way in time...

It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's day
As I walked through the enchanted forest
I heard the sound of horses, and men at arms
I felt compelled to walk on
And find the place of these sounds

And when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill
Before me the armies of the worlds standing, waiting
I thought to myself
For whom or for what are they waiting?

Suddenly a gust of wind came up
From the north there appeared a lone rider, holding a sword of steel
Then from the south came another, bearing a battle ax
From the east came a third holding a spiked club
And finally from the west, a rider who wielded a great hammer of war
With them came their soldiers of death
Followed by an army of immortals
They were few in number
But the look in their eyes told all who beheld them
That they would leave this day only in victory or death
And there was a great silence...

My heart began to pound
Storm clouds filled the sky with darkness
Rain came and the four winds blew with such anger
That I held fast to a tree
I watched the four riders raise their weapons into the air

Without warning, screaming their war cry
They led the attack, down to the battle they rode
They met the armies of the world with a mighty clash!
I could feel the ground shake
The earth drank much blood that day
Each of the four, was unto himself
A whirlwind of doom!

When the smoke did clear, many thousands were dead
There was much blood and gore
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battlefield
Like brown leaves blown by the wind
And I saw the four ride together to the top of the hill
While below them the soldiers of death assembled
All those who would now swear allegiance to them
And the four spoke the words
Of the warrior's prayer

Gods of war I call you, my sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death if I should ever fail
Glory, majesty, unity, hail, hail, hail

And as I stood and looked on
I heard the armies of the world hail them without end
And their voices of victory
Carried long and far throughout the land!

Well, that's it, did you like the story?
Yeah, it was great!
Oh good, I'm glad, now off to bed with you
Grandfather?
Yes?
Who were those four men?
Who were they?
They were the metal kings!Embed

Each Dawn I Die Lyrics[Verse 1]
Passing through the storm led by Demons
Walk between the world of men and Gods
Cast no shadows, draw no light
I rape the priestess on pagan night

[Verse 2]
I taste the serpent's poison
On the lips of the one I love
She brings this gift of witchcraft
I wear the cat skin gloves

[Verse 3]
Apples of youth when I wrought mischief
Hung on a tree to rot in the sun
Reborn in the middle of the final orgy
A gift of slavery to the chosen one

[Verse 4]
Suicide, suicide, don't you know me?
Call to the master, he will come
He will bring our resurrection
Cloaked in darkness, he has won

[Chorus]
Smoke from my sacrifice
Journey to the isle of the blessed
Grant my soul your glory, at nighttime, I'm your guest
Only I know why each dawn I die

Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal, together again

Cut into the earth till none shall remain

Revelation (Death’s Angel) LyricsAbove the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed, delivered by his hand
Now, clear the smoke
There the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man

What was written, foretold in dreams
In visions apocalypse now seen
And all self-righteous fools
Who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Dine with the Beast

Vindication, he's coming on the clouds
See his Angels
Hear their trumpets sound
The day of anger
When the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red
The sun turns black as night

Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star
The four Horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood
Fall on Satan's throne

Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death

By the morning star
The four Horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood
Fall on Satan's throne

Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze

God Or Man LyricsI arrive a stranger in this land and
Those who seek me their blood will wash the land
They who need me now reach out their hand
And If she heals me will I be god or man

Tell me who I am

Mother, son and daughter and father will be free

With blood upon my hammer
Now the wolves of men shall bleed

Metal Daze LyricsI hear the sound in a metal way
I feel the power rolling off the stage
Cause only one thing really sets me free
Heavy metal, loud as it can be

Baby, I was born to play music
I'm a man with a screaming guitar
There's a light in the middle of the stage
In a minute I'll be wearing it all
I don't know another way of living
Baby, I don't really care
Give me a pair of jeans and a riff that's mean
And girls that love to share

Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze

Living like there's no tomorrow
Currie says we're on the edge
He says, man you're really graphic
This band's a social wedge
We all got hearts made of metal
And our blood's hot molten rock
And if I don't hear the sound of metal
I go into shock

Spirit Horse of the Cherokee LyricsThe trail of tears began for the Cherokee
The white man came to trade and borrow
But then, they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery

We welcomed them as brothers
Knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters, not the hunted
As the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals
We live among them free
Our trail of tears would end
One day at Wounded Knee

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit Horse, ride for me

When we do the ghost dance
The buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war
Now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit, make us strong
Take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave
We are not afraid to die

There will be much more
The medicine man is dancing
He's calling us to war
Hatches sing with pride
Let the white man die

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit Horse, ride for me

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit Horse, ride for me

We are wild and free

Born in a Grave LyricsA gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light

While the world is sleeping, we all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the nights
When the day ends, life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears and we will never die

When the light goes away
We come out to play

Innocence lost and a Demon within
Forgive me, father
Yes, I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift of the day
I was born in a grave

Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl and the bats will fly
You never knew we were watching

Forgive me, father
Yes, I have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift of the day
I was born in a grave
I was born in a grave, born in a grave

Hymn of the Immortal Warriors LyricsA hero was he, touching all our lives
As if he lived and died
In a single moment
Great were his deeds
All his words were true
He lived and died a man of honour

He paid with his life
For his life was the price
To pass the gates immortal

Thy journey begins
With sword in the wind
Stay thy hand, rest thy command
For Odin's call was heard
Above them all
Thy name shall never die

Long shall we remember
He who walked the road of danger
Master of revenge, death's no stranger

Blood and death lived on his sword
The God of war, his only lord
Into the depths of Hell
Go all, he fell

Shall rise up from the grave

The gates of Valhalla and into legend

Rise, brother, rise, pass Valhalla's gates
Here great warriors await
Reborn from thy steel
All thy wounds be healed
From the earth to the sky
Now, the son of Odin rise
Take thy place among the kings
For thy soul shall never dieEmbed

King LyricsNow is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind, hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing
About heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die

Look and you'll see
That a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight
Through endless suffering

For all who believe wait a crown, a ring
The power of the man
Who would be king
The power of the man
Who would be king

Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind
Knows nothing's what it seems
The melting of the soul
The wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will
By destroyers of the dream

They live to spread the fear
Of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live
Like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power
To fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged
All across the land

We fight to stay alive
By the power of the will
The spirit to survive

To be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king

Freedom to bring a thought to the wing

Get a haircut and buy small gear"

Falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient Gods are calling me
I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die

Beneath the cloak of magic
I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look, but cannot find me
They think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them
Crashing to the ground

Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

I wear a sacred talisman
I make a secret sign
Now, welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman
A dragon I must ride

Now, eat the fruit of knowledge
Unto no-one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul

Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Demon's blood and dragon fire
Falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient Gods are calling me
I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die

Beneath the cloak of magic
I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look, but cannot find me
They think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them
Crashing to the ground
Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm

Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm

Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be re, die to be re
Die to be rebornEmbed

House of Death LyricsBlood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flames
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget

No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of Hell I will burn and die
Die, die, into the house of death
Die, die, into the fire of Hell

Army of the Heavens, my army waits in Hell
To battle on the earth for all the souls who fell
I will not go unto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death
Beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness
Into the black of night

No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of Hell I will burn and die
Die, die, into the house of death
Die, die, into the fire of Hell

Righteous Glory LyricsShe is watching from on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky

Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among the brave

In battle I shall die
In righteous glory I abide

She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain

To another place and time
Hold me in her arms

The Oath LyricsBurning embers of the second death
Will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega
Poison bites

False prophets and deceivers
Swing from the trees
Now, dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood
Like lepers with disease

Lord of the sky, Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

They'll find no sanctuary
Hidden in their ancestral halls
Let loose the knot that binds
The spirit and the flesh, let it fall
For only courage and heroism
Linger after death
So hold fast thy sword, rejecting pain

And my gun's never cold
I'm gambler, so bet on your life

Paid in gold for the blood I spill

Where Eagles Fly Lyrics[Intro]
Between the world of earth and sky
There's a place where eagles fly
There you'll find my heart and soul
Carried on the wind

And in you I believe
So the time I spent waiting
Is a moment passing, not a minute more

All the years that passed never changed my mind
What will be for us, will be in time
All the dreams we have one day will come true
Where еagles fly, I will wait for you

Here I'll pass thе night
With many battles left to fight
I'll see the sun rise once again
On a distant shore

Time will stop until the day

Secret of Steel LyricsAtop the mountain
Where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest
White was the snow
There as children
How could children know?
One without name or number
Soon would show

There stood he
On his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old

A scepter of iron could mercy bring
A shield of gold, the creator and king
And the great sword of steel
Sons of destiny shall wield

Hear wisdom's voice
Rise, know the strength that you feel
Hold in your heart, but never reveal
You were called by the Gods
Their powers to wield
Guard well the secret of steel

The Lord of Steel LyricsIn the nights, we take flights
Witness the sights
The power and glory of steel

I fought and died
Lived many lives before
I am immortal like my sword
I kneel to no-one except the lord
And my lord is steel

If you see me
You just passed your time
To the hills, can run but not hide
Blood and death are wherever I ride
Armed for battle, the lord on my side

Stand and face the lord of steel
The lord of steel

In the eyes of the lord you have sinned
Let your punishment begin
Only by death you atone
You shall not die alone

For the glory of battle
I'll fight until I die
Live one day as an eagle
Or a lifetime as a fly
Like a candle burning
The wheels of time are turning

The Heart of Steel MMXIV (Acoustic Intro) Lyrics[Joey DeMaio]
Build a fire a thousand miles away to light my long way home
I ride a comet
My trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone...
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind
Born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise with fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight

The Blood Of Odin LyricsUpon his shoulders perch two ravens, Huginn and Muninn. They circle the Earth by day seeing all. At night they report to him the world's tidings. He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring. At his side sit two wolves. His weapons, a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir. They are carved with runes. His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land sea and air. The bringer of the valiant dead, the Einherjar. From the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla

For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye. He was granted supreme wisdom. He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death. Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days. Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself. Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree. In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him. He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection, success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead

His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth. He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!

On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!You might also likeEmbed

All Men Play On Ten LyricsI made a rock n' roll sin, when I tried giving in
To make money had to turn down low
They said, "why be proud, don't play so loud, be like us
And get A sound that's real thin
Wear A polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get A haircut
And buy small gear"
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just A job, and while I'm playin'
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells A man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

While I'm burning up my gear, there's A fire in your ear
That won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then I run back the power rack and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just A job, and while I'm playing

Glory Majesty Unity LyricsDeep into the heart of the battle they fought
Covered on all sides as all converged on them
Until the four could no longer be seen
As time passed I feared them lost
Then slowly the armies separated
Many were dead
I saw the four
Each down on one knee
All stopped to watch and gaze upon them with a smile of victory
Before sending them into the ground

Then they rose together
To make a final stand
With their last bit of strength
They raised their arms into the air
Pointing blood stained weapons to the sky
They called upon the god of war and made ready to die
But Odin would not call them this day to Valhalla
Instead he sent thunder and lightning
To strike the ground, bestowing upon them the
One gift every warrior lives in hope of - the Berserker rage!

Now filled with that strength
The power of a thousand men was given them
No longer mortal
They were touched by the gods
This time when they took up the attack
Men fell not by tens
But by hundreds
By thousands
And when the smoke did clear
The four spoke the words
And the masses answered the response of the warrior's prayer

Hatred LyricsI taste your blood
As it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made

With heart filled hatred
Black blood runs through my veins
I take your powers
To the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth, ye wicked
Know the gruesome pain

I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside

My strength is hatred, torment and pain
Hatred, hatred
With heart filled hatred
Black blood runs through my veins

I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world, the rats that race

My strength is hatred, torment and pain
Hatred, hatred
With heart filled hatred

March For Revenge LyricsRide, ride, ride, ride up from hell

Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near
Maim and kill them, take the women and children

Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields
Maim and kill them, take the women and children

Fallen brother as i hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And i remember days long past
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet
For when we march, your sword rides with me
For when we march, your sword rides with me
For when we march, your sword rides with me
For when we march, your sword rides with me

You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. let your steel be tried

Burning LyricsWe have come from the ashes
Of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire
On the altar of pain
Led into temptation
Now, the black Gods align
Here, there is no salvation
And your blood is my wine

Here's a world that is waiting
Between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure
Are eternally wet
All is all for the taking, for a life or a lie
At the end of the breaking
I'll be watching you die

Crawl to the silence, renounce and deny
The stars and the numbers
Foretold of this time
To the words and the wisdom
To the promise of lies
By their anger and fury
The strong will surviveYou might also likeEmbed

Well die together in the end

Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my
Soul.He calls my name,and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in
Blood to pay.And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if
I falter on my way.And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the briges I now cross it giving
Him my soul

Sucred right to burn in hell,ride up to hells
Hot wind.Face one more evilthan thou,take

Drink my blood as I drink yours,impale me on

Cut off my head release all my evel Lucifer is king

His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame

Void for eternity I give to him my soul

Otac (Father - Croatian Version) LyricsKad sam bio mali
Ti si me uzeo za ruku
Oce ti si trebao znati
Da sam ja konacno razumio

Naucio me lose od dobroga
I da zivim
Dao najbolji poklon
Sto bi mi iko mogao dati

Nikada me nisi razocarao
Napravio si me jacim
Kada sam pravio greske
Kada nisam bio u pravu

Nekada smo veseli
A nekada tuzni
Znao si jednoga dana
Ja cu priznati da si bio u pravu

Uvjek si sa mnom
U svakoj rjeci
U svakom satu
U svakom danu
U svemu sta radim
Ja sam dio tebe

Thy Crown and Thy Ring MMXIV (Metal Version) LyricsFrom a battle I've come, to a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty, alone we are Kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me, my enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow, string and steel will prevail
High and mighty, alone we are Kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin, I await thee, your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom of Steel
High and mighty, alone we are Kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our prideYou might also likeEmbed

On Wheels of Fire MMXIV Lyrics[Joey DeMaio]
Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
Blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to rideYou might also likeEmbed

Manowar - live LyricsWe met on English ground
In a backstage room, we heard the sound
And we all knew what we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew and we all knew
Soon the time would come for us to fight
Destination now in sight
Oh, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we called on partisans
To raise your hands and take our stand
Look sharp when duty calls
Where we march cities fall
And the strong survive and take our side
Now the time has come for us to fight
Target waiting in our sight
Oh, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore

Born to live forever more

The right to conquer every shore

Spirit horse of cherokees LyricsThe trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade and borrow
But then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery
We welcomed them as brothers, knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted, as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among them free
Our trail of tears would end, one day at wounded knee
Great spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit horse ride for me
When we do the ghost dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war now blood and fire burn
Great spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die
Great spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit horse ride for me
Red cloud, black hawk, sitting bull
Crazy horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave
Warriors to the grave
There has been much killing
There will be much more
The medicine man is dancing
He's calling us to war
Hatchets sing with pride
Let the white men die
Great spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit horse ride for me
Great spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit horse ride for me

We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky

Gods of War (Immortal Version) LyricsFather on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die
Our blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy valkyries fly

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us

A Warrior’s Prayer MMXIV Lyrics"Grandfather, tell me a story."
"Oh, all right, Go and get your storybook."
"No, no, not one of those. A real story!"
"A real story?"
"Yes! Tell me about when you were a boy!"
"Well, then, I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time..."


It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's day. As I walked through the enchanted forest, I could hear the sound of horses and men at arms
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place of these sounds
And when the forest did clear I was standing on a hill. Before me the armies of the world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself, 'For whom or what are they waiting?'
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north. There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword of steel
Then from the south came another, bearing a battle ax
From the east came a third, holding a spiked club, and finally, from the west, a rider who wielded a great hammer of war
With them came their soldiers of death, followed by an army of immortals
They were few in number, but the look in their eyes told all who beheld them that they would leave this place only in victory or death
And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled the sky with darkness, and the four winds blew with such anger that I held fast to a tree
I watched the four riders raise their weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming their war cry they led the attack. Down to the battle they rode
They met the armies of the world with a mighty clash! I could feel the ground shake. The earth drank much blood that day
Each of the four, was unto himself, a whirlwind of doom!

When the smoke did clear, many thousands were dead. There was much blood and gore
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battlefield like brown leaves blown by the wind
And I saw the four ride together to the top of the hill, while below them the soldiers of death assembled
All those who would now swear allegiance to them
And the four spoke the words of the warriors prayer:
You might also like"Gods of war I call you, my sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death if I should ever fail
Glory, majesty, unity
Hail, hail, hail."

And as I stood and looked on, I heard the armies of the world hail them without end, and their voices of victory carried long and far throughout the land!

"Well, that's it. Did you like the story?"
"Yeah, it was great!"
"Oh good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you."
"Grandfather?"
"Yes?"
"Who were those four men?"
"Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!"Embed

The Glory of Achilles LyricsBlack candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering
Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire
As the seven steps aqait, hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure, the enemy of the soul
From the misery and sadness, of the molten seas of hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols in evil dreams there dwell
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering
A deadly drink, a meal of hearts, now sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction, behold the evil eye
And the Demon's whip
Armies of the gods of hell ride across the atral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves borne on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Night winds, Oblivion see my dark desire
Come forth, appear he is living fire
Feel the Demon's whip
Armies of the gods of hell ride across the atral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves borne on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin

Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me

I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death

Aaah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself

Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die let valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
